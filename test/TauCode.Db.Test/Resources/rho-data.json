[Suddenly fame hit],\ntransforming the rules of Web development.\n\nIt’s not that Ruby on Rails contained revolutionary technology [but that]\nthe concept took existing ingredients and blended them in such [a compelling and appealing] way [as to put] existing\nplatforms to shame.\n\nBy applying MVC and working [in tune] with the HTTP protocol\n\nIt was [as if this was how] Web development [should have been all along].\n\nNode.js [has been around since] 2009 and gained acceptance quickly\n\nNode.js remains a niche technology. Its biggest contribution to web app development has, [rather oddly], been\nto provide a consistent JavaScript engine on which development tools can be written.\n\nNode.js [adoption] for deploying web apps has been slower.\n\nThe ASP.NET MVC Framework implements the MVC pattern and, [in doing so], provides greatly improved\nseparation of concerns.\n\nASP.NET MVC has, in many ways, pushed [forward beyond what even] Rails can offer.\n\nUse the default implementation of the component [as it stands]\n\nDerive a subclass of the default implementation to [tweak] its behavior.\n\nInstead of generating out [swathes] of HTML [over which you have] little control, the MVC Framework encourages you to [craft] simple, elegant markup styled with CSS.\n\nOf course, if you [do want] to throw in some [ready-made] widgets for complex UI elements such as date pickers or\ncascading menus, ASP.NET MVC’s [“no special requirements” approach] to markup makes it easy to use [best-of-breed]\nUI libraries such as jQuery UI or the Bootstrap CSS library.\n\nI describe Knockout in Chapter 27 and I use Bootstrap ([albeit] without a detailed introduction) throughout the book.\n\nASP.NET MVC [works in tune] with HTTP.\n\nso you can [fine-tune] your user experience as much as you like\n\n[Yet] the ASP.NET MVC designers didn’t stop there.\n\nEven if you have never written a unit test before, [you will be off] to a great start.\n\nSecond, many Web users are now [savvy] enough to understand a URL, and [appreciate the option] of navigating\n\nsee my [forthcoming] Pro ASP.NET MVC 5 Platform\n\nTo get [the most] from this book,\n\nDon’t worry if you are a little [hazy] on the client-side details.\n\nIn the next chapter you will [dive right in] and create a simple web application\n\nthrough which I show you a realistic development process [from inception to deployment], [touching on] the major features of the ASP.NET MVC Framework.\n\n[That said], I don’t want you to have to buy a second book to learn about something as important as user security\n\nand [my hope is] that the delay won’t be too long.\n\nI added a chapter that shows how one of the open source libraries that Microsoft [has embraced] — Knockout — can be combined with the Web API feature to create Single-Page Applications (SPAs).\n\nThe best way [to appreciate a software development framework] is [to jump right in] and use it.\n\nbut I recommend that you do — [not least because] it will help you make sense of the examples in this book.\n\nYou will [almost certainly] see a different port\n\nthis is a [cut-down version] of the full IIS application server\n\nThis is a good [example of benefiting from] following MVC conventions.\n\nwithout having to define classes [ahead of time]\n\nI am going to [pick up the pace] in this section.\n\nThis is another [skeletal] HTML file,"
